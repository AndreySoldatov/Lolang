This is public page of my thoughts on the new PL.
The main purpose is to fight boredom, but also to create something
that will provide cool features as Rust (traits, tuples) but also be
as fluent and easy to use and read as C++(for me)
and have c interopability (mainly through this language being compiled to C itself);
